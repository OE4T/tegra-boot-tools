/**
 * Definition of the device manager parameters structure.
 *
 * The device parameter structure is a union of the parameter structures
 * of all the classes of secondary boot devices.
 *
 * The values in the BCT's device parameter structures are used to 
 * reinitialize the driver prior to reading BLs.  This mechanism gives the
 * system designer an opportunity to store values tuned for maximum performance
 * with the specific devices in the system.  In contrast, the values initially
 * used by the Boot ROM to read BCTs are geared toward universality across
 * a wide set of potential parts, not tuned to the characteristics of a
 * specific device.
 *
 * The array of device parameter structures in the BCT permits the storage
 * of sets of optimized parameters for different devices, which supports
 * different board stuffing options, multiple sourcing of parts, etc.
