/**
 * @file nvboot_hash.h
 *
 * Defines the NvBootHash data structure for the Boot ROM.
 *
 * The Boot ROM uses the AES-CMAC keyed hash function for validating objects
 * read from the secondary boot device.
 *
 * The AES-CMAC algorithm is defined in RFC 4493 published by the Internet 
 * Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The RFC is available at the following web 
 * site, among others --
 *
 *    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4493
 *
 * The 128-bit variant is implemented here, i.e., AES-CMAC-128.  This variant
 * employs an underlying AES-128 encryption computataion.
 *
 * This implementation only handles messages that are a multiple of 16 bytes in
 * length.  The intent is to compute the hash value for AES-encrypted messages
 * which (by definition) are always a multiple of 16 bytes in length.  Hence,
 * the K2 constant will never be used and therefore is not even computed.
 * Similarly, there's no provision for padding packets since they're already
 * required to be a multiple of 16 bytes in length.
